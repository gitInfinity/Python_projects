# Python projects
These are my python projects that i have made so far in university. Both are part of my forth semester and are group projects. Both projects use Python as its primary language and both use libraries and modules to implement the functionalities. 

## DFA_minimization (TOA_fin.ipynb)
In this project, we use data structures like sets, lists, and dictionaries to implement a deterministic finite automaton and all of its components. My contribution to this project was making the first and second check functions and also implementing a small portion of the main minimization function. Libraries like matplotlib and graphviz were used to visualise the final automaton.

## Gradient_descent (NC.ipynb)
Here we implemented a simple linear regression model using gradient descent. We used libraries like numpy, math and pandas to implement the main gradient descent model and then used matplotlib, tabulate, plotly and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for the visualisation. My contribution to this project was making the cost and hypothesis function and a small portion of the gradient descent model.
